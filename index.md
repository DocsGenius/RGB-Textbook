# Red · Green · Blue  
### A Systems Thinking & Design Textbook

## Purpose

**Red Green Blue** is evolving.

Originally conceived as a Test Driven Development (TDD) textbook, this project has grown into a broader exploration of **systems thinking, modeling, and design**. Testing remains a foundational pillar—but it is now framed as one tool among many for understanding, shaping, and sustaining complex systems.

This textbook aims to introduce systems design from the ground up:  
how to reason about constraints, feedback loops, abstractions, tradeoffs, and long-term behavior—*before* code, during development, and long after deployment.

The goal is simple:  
to make systems design **approachable, practical, and intellectually satisfying**, especially for developers who never received a formal introduction.

> This site currently serves as a landing page.  
> **More chapters, diagrams, and case studies are actively being developed.**, the below content is an AI written overview of the some 2-3000 new words of changes in the same format as my old summary -- The textbook is human made entirely, but I am swamped in trying to finish my bachelor's (50 some credits left, and completing 27~+ credits in the last 4 weeks at WGU with intense studying)

## Who It’s For

- **College students** looking for an intuitive entry point into systems modeling, testing, and optimization  
- **Self-taught developers** who want to formalize their intuition  
- **Indie developers & solo builders** designing systems without enterprise overhead  
- **Experienced engineers** seeking a fresh, first-principles perspective on design  
- **Readers of TDD** who want to understand *where testing fits in the larger system*

The book balances theory with concrete examples, helping readers build mental models—not just implementations.

---

## From TDD to Systems Design

Red Green Blue began with a narrow focus on Test Driven Development:  
*fail, pass, refactor.*

Over time, a larger pattern emerged.

Testing is not the system—it is a **feedback mechanism**.  
Refactoring is not cleanup—it is **system evolution**.  
Design is not upfront—it is **continuous sense-making**.

This textbook reframes familiar development practices as components of broader systems:
- software systems  
- organizational systems  
- feedback-driven learning systems  
- long-lived technical ecosystems  

TDD remains central, but now lives inside a wider, more powerful context.

## A Little About Me

I’m Roman—an aspiring author and long-time solo developer from Virginia (USA).

I’ve spent nearly a decade building modular software: plugins, extensions, and features that must coexist with existing systems. That kind of work forces you to think in boundaries, interfaces, and unintended consequences—whether you have the language for it or not.

Like many developers, I learned systems thinking *implicitly*, through failure.  
This book is an attempt to make those lessons **explicit**, earlier, and more humane.

My hope is that this first edition establishes a foundation that can grow alongside my career—expanding with new insights, new systems, and new mistakes worth sharing.

## What Do the Colors Mean *Now*?

The colors still matter.

- **Red** — Signals, constraints, failure, and feedback  
- **Green** — Stability, flow, working paths through a system  
- **Blue** — Structure, refactoring, and long-term design

Together, they describe a loop that exists in *all* systems—not just tests:
observe → adapt → restructure.

This book uses that loop as a recurring lens, applying it to codebases, architectures, workflows, and teams.

## Sample Text (Coming Soon)

Early drafts, diagrams, and chapter excerpts will be published here as the manuscript grows.

Planned early chapters include:
- Thinking in Systems (Without the Math)
- Feedback Loops in Software
- Testing as Signal, Not Safety
- Local Decisions vs Global Behavior
- When Abstractions Break

---

## Status & Roadmap

- **Current state:** Early manuscript & concept refinement  
- **Now:** Collection of essays, diagrams, and chapter outlines  
- **Target:** Rough Draft by middle-late **2026**, at a 133-words-per-day pace  
- **Peer review:** Planned early **2027**

This page will expand as the textbook does.
