Red Green Blue - Test Driven Development

### Purpose
Red Green Blue describes the three state loop in which software is developed. As a hobbyist software developer, I've spent almost a decade honing the craft and reading many books on the subject, with the sub-genre is under-saturated I decided to create an entry level textbook.
The use of colors describes the mental imagery of the lowest loop in TDD, fail - suffice - refactor.

### Audience
The book is written for those unfamiliar with tests, and also provides for anyone in the uncertain shoes of solo development.

### About the author
I'm Roman, an aspiring author from Virginia (USA) and enthusiast of many disciplines. I've most fondly spent my time developing software, particularly plugins and features that coinside with existing solutions. In that specific realm of software development, one is typically creating very modular and highly utile solutions -- which ultimately requires **testing**! In my pursuit for knowledge on 'clean code', I had found Test Driven Development -- and have since read a few books on the matter. Tests have become my non-negotiable for software development, and as it comes for the future it's the perfect way to utilize A.I.! I'm excited to declare this book to enter peer review, and open suggestions, by fall 2026!
